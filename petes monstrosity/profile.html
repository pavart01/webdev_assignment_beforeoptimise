    <h1>A bit about us!</h1>

    <p>
        Hot Beans Web was established in 2007 by David Wood, who previously held roles in a multi-national business. He saw the potential for a slightly different type of Web Design Agency: David wanted to create an agency that could deliver good quality websites at affordable prices, without compromising on quality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over a decade and a half later, it has proven to be a successful formula. We have seen the business grow year on year for both Hot Beans and our clients. We have our head office in Peterborough and offices in Northampton.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Trusting Clients</h2>
    <p>
        Our client base includes many different types and sizes of business, ranging from sole traders and SMEs all the way through to household names.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hot Beans has had direct and indirect development contracts with some of the world's biggest names, including Belkin, DSG Group, Ingram Micro, Halfords, Nationwide, and Tesco. However, our favourite customers are those who embrace a website to help start and develop their businesses, such as local plumbers, builders, electricians, home builders, and gardeners.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are always here to help and believe in Givers Gain. If you need any help or advice, we are here to help, and we never charge for any consultation.
    </p>
    <h2>Our People</h2>
    <p>
        We are so proud of the people who make Hot Beans who we are. They are a unique set of web designers, web developers, and marketers who come together to deliver on the one shared philosophy: to provide the best solutions for website design to our existing and new customers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The team at Hot Beans is unusually diverse for the web design industry. As a team, we can focus more on our clients' objectives and deliver custom web design and development to exceed our customers' expectations every time.
